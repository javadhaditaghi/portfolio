        <p>The need to study the text critically is one of the essential areas in human sciences. People need to know about the discursive load of the text to recognize how powerful interests influence them through the medium of the text. In this regard, Laclau and Mouffe's discourse theory is one of the rudimentary models of discourse analysis (DA) that has now become prevalent in research studies. The prime target in Laclau and Mouffe's discourse theory is the embedded ideological and power relations in the text. We chose this theory among other theories, e.g., critical discourse analysis (CDA) and Foucauldian analysis, to abandon the distinction between discursive and non-discursive and lead the notion of discourse to a broader area of analysis. In order to operationalize Laclau and Mouffe's discourse theory, we considered voice as a consciousness that constructs its own irreducible discursive identity.
            Regarding the voice in discourse theory, we analyzed the text on two levels: analysis of focused, systematic interaction and analysis of unfocused random behavior. At the first level, the corpus was collected from the Touchstone textbook (beginning). Then, the corpus was transformed to network in three levels: sentence, paragraph or section, and passage. Moreover, we used facilities of network theory such as degree, weighted degree, eigenvector centrality, and modularity as prior equipment to find the nodal point of identity and empty signifiers. They also lead to realizing subject positioning, group formation, and representation as three stages in focused, systematic interaction. At the second level, we used William's keywords of society and culture, which Bennett and his colleagues updated, to study the overdetermination of our float signifier as a proxy.
            Regarding these two stages, we developed a new approach, Networked Discursive Analysis (NDA), toward Laclau and Mouffe's discourse theory. Then, we delineated the way voices in conflict lead to the overdetermination of float signifiers in society. As a final point, it could be stated that based on the context of analysis, which is an English textbook, the findings of this study could reveal the significant role of the textbook as the mediator of culture. Additionally, the present study developed a new insight into the concept of voice, which is one of the fundamental concepts in critical pedagogy.
